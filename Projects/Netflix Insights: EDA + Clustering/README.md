## Analysis Covered

* Content Types: Movies vs TV Shows distribution
* Top Genres & Categories
* Country-wise Content Production
* Release Trends Across Years
* Ratings Breakdown & Duration Patterns



## Key Insights

* Most content comes from the United States, followed by India and other countries.
* TV Shows are increasingly popular in recent years.
* Certain genres dominate, e.g., dramas and comedies.
* Top directors and actors appear frequently across multiple titles.
* Movie durations mostly range from 80–120 minutes.
* Clustering reveals natural groupings of content that can inform recommendations.

## Technologies & Libraries

* Python (Pandas, NumPy)
* Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
* Text Processing (TF-IDF Vectorizer)
* Machine Learning (Scikit-learn for clustering)

## Usage

* Load the dataset and preprocess missing values.
* Perform EDA to explore distributions, trends, and correlations.
* Apply clustering algorithms to group similar content.
* Visualize clusters and analyze patterns.

## Potential Extensions

* Build a content-based recommendation system using cluster info.
* Include user ratings or preferences for personalized suggestions.
* Predict popularity or ratings using machine learning models.
